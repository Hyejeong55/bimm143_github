Today we will take a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween Candy.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

## What is your favorite candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["M&M's",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

>  Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others.

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

The one represents the candy that is chocolate, and the zero represents the candy that is not chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=30)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="lightblue")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution is not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
The center of the distribution is below 50% because the median is 47.83%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.inds,]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

```{r}
fruit.win2 <- candy[as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win2)
```

The chocolate candy ranks higher on average than fruity candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
ans
```

Yes, it is statistically significant with a p-value of `r ans$p.value`.

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here. One is the classic `sort()` and `order()`.

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```

The least liked candy is Nik L Nip.

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=TRUE),], n=5)
```

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a `bar` or not.

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, 
      y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)

# ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=8)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets 

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## Winpercent VS Pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
# The pink is too washed out
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

# How about a plot of price vs win

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=2.2, max.overlaps = 8)
```

## Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated.

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Excluding the correlation between variables that are the same on both axis, the chocolate and winpercent variables have the most positive correlation.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA because we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(size=2, max.overlaps = 10, col=my_cols) +
  theme_bw()
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation`. We can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, pluribus, and hard are all in the positive direction. Yes, this does make sense because these are the variables that were least likely to have a positive correlation with the variable "chocolate".
