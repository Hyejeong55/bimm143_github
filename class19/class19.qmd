> Q2. 

- open in Seaview and use your eyes or a consensus sequence

- ask ChatGPT

- read the sequences into R with the **bio3d** package

```{r}
library(bio3d)

sequence.aln <- read.fasta('A16837133_mutant_seq.fa')
```

Let's try score conservation:

```{r}
score <- conserv(sequence.aln)
score
```

There are 1 for conserved and less than one for the mutation sites

```{r}
mutant.position <- which(score < 1)
mutant.position
```

```{r}
sequence.aln$ali[,mutant.position]
```
